# Steel Bridge Bar Stress Analysis Model

This repository contains a simulation model for analyzing the **strain**, **displacement**, and **stress** of a typical steel bridge construction bar. The test model serves as a foundational tool for structural engineers, researchers, and students aiming to understand mechanical behavior under various load conditions.

---

## 🧠 Features

- Simulates **strain**, **displacement**, and **stress** distribution in a steel bar.
- Ideal for testing load responses in bridge construction scenarios.
- Can be extended or integrated with more complex structural simulations.
